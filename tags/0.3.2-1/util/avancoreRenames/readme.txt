    Sync'd Avancore0.3 with Avacnore0.2svn276
    Important! Next diff must be between 278 and HEAD versions, because 0.2r277 only has line-endings fixed!
    Take last update patches and tools and extend them if needed. 
    
    Script diff3to2.sh may be used to compare Ac0.3 and Ac0.2 versions 
    (usage: diff3to2.sh <Ac3file> <Ac2file>; will produce .patch file)
