Roadmap

    -   Basic usable Application-Controller-Output chain
        -   Usable controller
            -   decide WHAT action should return methods and how to deal with their output
            -   a   -   response prototype
                        -   special case 1: json response
                        -   special case 2: download or content stream response
                b   -   template call
                c   -   forward call
            -   getUrl() should work solidly
            -   response caching
            -   make sure that string objects are properly converted (to implements SEFs later)
        -   Implement templates and proper passing of data to templates and their parts
        -   Simple way to define controller in Application
        -   Front controller
        -   Application creates and calls Output

    -   Update Codegen to support current application & controller with legacy data model
        
        -   Create Application skeleton
        -   Create Controller base class

    -   Fix forms library (at least make sure that it works in new Ac)
    -   Migrate
