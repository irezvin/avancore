+ Ae_Sql_Db is now abstract, added proper method visibility ('protected' instead of '_')
+ Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper() supports $application instance and passing instance directly instead of 'mapper class' string
- Dropped Ae_Config references in Ae_Legacy_Database and its descendant
- Removed Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() references in Cg_ family and code templates
+ Added addAssetLibs(), replacePrefixes() to Ae_Legacy_Controller_Response_Html; Ae_Output now provides Ae_Application instance to it
+ Ae_Util::htmlspecialchars now uses ENT_QUOTES by default (but I have to review htmlspecialchars in other parts of the framework yet)

+ Removed calls to Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() before usage of classes, since framework already depends on autoloading
- Ae_Model_Object will no more forget/restore $this->_db dependency during the sleep

+ Ae_Application is now provider of mapper instances
+ Basic support for table-independent mappers and model objects via Ae_Model_Mapper / Ae_Model_Object instances.
+ Cg now creates Ae_Application descendants with mapper prototypes instead of static 'Domain' classes
+ Dropped Ae_Dispatcher::getMapper() in favor of Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper()
