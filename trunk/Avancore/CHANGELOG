- Dropped Ac_Value_Deferred, Ac_Value_DeferredString and supporting classes
+ Ac_I_Evaluated and Ac_I_StringObject families with supporting classes and tests

2012-08-08

+ Created basic Ac_Response and Ac_Content hierarchy
+ Ac_Buffer: a feature to pass objects' and echo() calls to callback
+ Ac_Impl_Cleanup and Ac_I_Cleanup to clean objects' references
+ Ac_Debug: update from Ae_Debug
+ Ac_Content_StructuredText: a foundation for structured responses 

2012-07-30

* Renamed Ac_Param_Value to Ac_Accessor_Path for clarity (Ac_Test_Params > Ac_Test_AccessorPath)
+ Ac_Accessor_PathRef: path object capable to call src methods

2012-07-28

X Moved all to-be-abandoned or to-be-rewritten classes to /obsolete directory

2012-07-27

+ Added Ac_Param_Value
+ Work-in-progress on Ac_Cr_Controller
* Tests: index.php can now run several tests by specifying comma-separated class list

2012-07-23

+ Added setCollectErrors() to Ac_Accessor (currently exceptions are not wrapped)

2012-07-22

+ Added Ac_Prototype_Builder & Ac_Prototype_Chain
+ Renamed Ac_Autoparams, Ac_I_Autoparams to Ac_Prototyped and Ac_I_Prototyped; renamed $options to $prototype
+ Moved all static methods for property access from Ac_Autoparams (now Ac_Prototyped) to Ac_Accessor
+ Ac_Accessor::mapFunctionArgs for by-name passing; Ac_Prototyped::factory now accepts __initialize args 
  and allows __constructor keys to be passed by arg name.
+ Ac_Prototyped descendants now accept __initialize key with methodName => args too

2012-07-20

+ Created Ac_Accessor with Strategy dependency (Ac_I_AccessorStrategy); used them in Ac_Cr_Strategy to implement 'magic' properties 'param' & 'use'.
+ Added Ac_Autoparams::factoryOnce for helper flyweight classes.
+ Added Ac_Request::populate() function to help to create virtual requests based on Url & post values

2012-07-18

+ Small fixes to Ac_Application, Ac_Util & Ac_Autoparams
+ Added Ac_Request family (with _Src and _Accessor sub-classes), tests for them
+ Added Ac_Cr_Url
* Fixed some tests that involved legacy database

2012-03-22

+ Ae_Sql_Db is now abstract, added proper method visibility ('protected' instead of '_')
+ Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper() supports $application instance and passing instance directly instead of 'mapper class' string
- Dropped Ae_Config references in Ae_Legacy_Database and its descendant
- Removed Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() references in Cg_ family and code templates
+ Added addAssetLibs(), replacePrefixes() to Ae_Legacy_Controller_Response_Html; Ae_Output now provides Ae_Application instance to it
+ Ae_Util::htmlspecialchars now uses ENT_QUOTES by default (but I have to review htmlspecialchars in other parts of the framework yet)

2012-03-06

+ Removed calls to Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() before usage of classes, since framework already depends on autoloading
- Ae_Model_Object will no more forget/restore $this->_db dependency during the sleep

2012-03-04

+ Ae_Application is now provider of mapper instances
+ Basic support for table-independent mappers and model objects via Ae_Model_Mapper / Ae_Model_Object instances.
+ Cg now creates Ae_Application descendants with mapper prototypes instead of static 'Domain' classes
+ Dropped Ae_Dispatcher::getMapper() in favor of Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper()

2012-03-03

+ Ae_I_Autopoarams can be used to tag classes whose constructors accept prototype arrays

2012-2014

....A lot of time has passed....
and many small improvements have been done

2014-02-05

+ Renamed Cg to Ac_Cg
+ Moved Form, Table, Model, Admin class trees from obsolete/ back to classes/ (they seem immortal)

2014-02-07

Large number of admin- and facet- related changes and small bugifxes

* Ac_Form_Control_List: improved 'chosen' type support
+ Ac_Admin_Feature_DebugSql: feature that displays current SQL select statement for admin list
+ Ac_Admin_Manager::$dontCount support, also rudimentary no-count support in Ac_Admin_Paginator 
  (will work event if records count is not provided)
* Ac_Admin_Manager::$featureSettings now OVERRIDE values provided 
  by Ac_Model_Mapper_Info::$adminFeatures
* Fix images path in Ac_Admin_ManagerConfigService_J25
* Ac_Facet_Sql_SetImpl::getSelectPrototypeWithFacets(), applyFacetsToSearchInstance() for more
  fine-grained integration with Select managed by outside application
+ Ac_Form_Converter now overrides created proto with Ac_Model_Property->$controlPrototype 
  if it's provided
+ Ac_Sql_Part now use Ac_Util::m instead of array_merge to merge where, order and groupBy clauses,
  that allows to specify keys to combine criteria into AND/OR groups
+ Ac_Url::getJsPostRedirect() now allows to specify which parts of query will pass ino query args
  and which will get into hidden POST fields
+ Ac_Util::flattenArray has $keyGlue arg to join keys instead of ignoring them

2014-02-10

Introduced Ac_Sql_Db->args(); Ac_Form_Control_Params update; small Cg improvements; bugfixes.

- Removed Ac_Legacy_Controller::getContextInfo() since it's surely not used (creates non-existent
  class)
+ Ac_Form_Control_Parameters is now JForms compatible (but requires Joomla2.5+)
+ Ac_Application_Adapter->$appRootDir, Ac_Application_Adapter->getAppRootDir()
+ Ac_Cg_Model->$altDomainPrefix (to prefix model classes with something different instead 
  of Ac_Cg_Domain->$appName
* Fix chmod-related warnings during Ac_Cg_ run
* Ac_Model_Object->isChanged() now accepts second parameter, $strict = true
+ Added Ac_Sql_Db->args() to prefix query call with query arguments
+ Added Ac_Legacy_Controller_Std_Web->$cacheDebug = false to disable firebug-related debug messages,
  changed calls to Ac_Debug::fb
* Fixed some warnings in to-be-obsoleted Ac_Mail
