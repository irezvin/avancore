+ Created Ac_Accessor with Strategy dependency (Ac_I_AccessorStrategy); used them in Ac_Cr_Strategy to implement 'magic' properties 'param' & 'use'.
+ Added Ac_Autoparams::factoryOnce for helper flyweight classes.
+ Added Ac_Request::populate() function to help to create virtual requests based on Url & post values

2012-07-18

+ Small fixes to Ac_Application, Ac_Util & Ac_Autoparams
+ Added Ac_Request family (with _Src and _Accessor sub-classes), tests for them
+ Added Ac_Cr_Url
* Fixed some tests that involved legacy database

2012-03-22

+ Ae_Sql_Db is now abstract, added proper method visibility ('protected' instead of '_')
+ Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper() supports $application instance and passing instance directly instead of 'mapper class' string
- Dropped Ae_Config references in Ae_Legacy_Database and its descendant
- Removed Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() references in Cg_ family and code templates
+ Added addAssetLibs(), replacePrefixes() to Ae_Legacy_Controller_Response_Html; Ae_Output now provides Ae_Application instance to it
+ Ae_Util::htmlspecialchars now uses ENT_QUOTES by default (but I have to review htmlspecialchars in other parts of the framework yet)

2012-03-06

+ Removed calls to Ae_Dispatcher::loadClass() before usage of classes, since framework already depends on autoloading
- Ae_Model_Object will no more forget/restore $this->_db dependency during the sleep

2012-03-04

+ Ae_Application is now provider of mapper instances
+ Basic support for table-independent mappers and model objects via Ae_Model_Mapper / Ae_Model_Object instances.
+ Cg now creates Ae_Application descendants with mapper prototypes instead of static 'Domain' classes
+ Dropped Ae_Dispatcher::getMapper() in favor of Ae_Model_Mapper::getMapper()

2012-03-03

+ Ae_I_Autopoarams can be used to tag classes whose constructors accept prototype arrays
