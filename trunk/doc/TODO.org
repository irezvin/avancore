** Fix long-term bugs
*** WORK convert nullable empty foreign keys to NULL before saving since it annoys a lot :model:bug:
    - Definitions:  <<freeFields>>
      - *free foreign field*: is not part of PK or other FK, or has meta-property isRestricted == false
      - *restricted foreign field*: is part of PK or ther FK, or has meta-property isRestricted == true
    - [X] already implemented for single-field key
    - [ ] should be converted to null if...
      - it is part of foreign key
      - is nullable and is "empty" (empty string, 0, '0')
	- OR referenced object is set to NULL
      - this field is *free* (see above)
    - [ ] we should report if field is part of foreign key
      - [ ] report 'outgoingRelations' => array('relId1', 'relId2'...)
      - [ ] intListReferenceFields() should use format 'field' => array('relationId' => 'objectPropertyName', ...)
      - [ ] what should we do in that case? -- nullify
    - [ ] test cases
      - [ ] case A: field is an exact foreign key
      - [ ] case B: field is a PART of foreign key, other field is part of other FK or PK
*** TODO Foreign 'ids' are lost in N-N relation of Ac_Model_Object during setFooIds() after getFoo() :model:bug:
    steps to re-produce:
    - we have some "property", which loads external object(s) during evaluation
    - we setID/IDs in the form
    - object begins to save 
    - "validation" checks the "property", and related objects are loaded
    - after that ID/IDs won't be used since we have object properties' populated
**** TODO N-N relations must obey model' ID lists (if IDs property is filled-in, it should be used instead of mid-table content) [2013-09-27 Fri] :model:feature:
*** TODO when trying to receive N-N-linked object, generated code of the model instance produces bugs :model:bug:
    Example: where are relation categories <- NN -> products
    When trying $this->getField('products[0][foo]'), when no 'product' with '0' index is present, the error message 
    is being displayed regarding inability to load related object.
*** TODO Ac_Model_Object::reset() fix [2014-07-25 Fri] 	       :model:cg:bug:
    - [ ] should also nullify internal fields with relation data (counts, ids, relation references)
      - [ ] list of such internal fields must be provided by Cg
    - [ ] Ac_Model_Record::reset() should load defaults from mapper
    - [ ] Ac_Model_Object::getOwnResetData() <- is overridden in generated version; returns defaults in Record 
*** TODO Ac_Sql_Select: don't join tables, which are specified in $this->tables[$this->primaryAlias]->joinsAlias [2013-08-27 Tue] :sql:bug:
*** TODO after model changes, the $form->fetchPresentation(true) should return updated data :forms:redesign:bug:

* Unassigned tasks
** Began and not finished
*** WORK Qualifiers in relations	[2013-12-09 Mon] :model:feature:major:
    - requires: logical relations
*** WORK Ac_Sql_Db->debugNext()->query(...), Ac_Sql_Db->args(array)->query(...) [2013-12-09 Mon]  :sql:feature:minor:
    Ability to provide extra params for next request (DB instance is returned for chaining)
**** args/a: We CANNOT mix positional args, but can mix named ones
     After the request param values are "forgotten". But args() with no arguments allows to "remember" last ones.
     $foo = 10; 
     //...
     $bar = 20;
     //...
     Ac_Sql_Db->args(compact('foo', 'bar'))->query("SELECT :foo, :bar");
     Ac_Sql_Db->args()->query("SELECT :foo, :bar"); // will re-use last args
     //...
**** debugNext
     Ac_Sql_Db->debugNext(Ac_Sql_Db::DEBUG_DIE_DONT_RUN)->query("SELECT 'stuff'");
     // also DEBUG_SHOW_RESULT, DEBUG_DIE_AFTER, DEBUG_FIREPHP - bit mask 

     debug: the SQL will always be shown
     DEBUG_DIE_DONT_RUN = 1 //  DEBUG_DIE_AFTER = 2 // request is run, but then we will die()
     DEBUG_SHOW_RESULT = 4 // result will be shown after the request (max. 100 lines)
     DEBUG_FIREPHP = 16 // all info through FirePHP
*** WORK switch to getters and seters instead of Ac_Model_Data::bind(). NN IDs must have priority over linked object (if it wasn't set?) :model:redesign:
       	 when $this->_fooIds is changed, getFoos() should return proper values
**** TODO gen. code: currently only data members with accessors should be protected
**** TODO compatibility with Ac_Model_Relation using $this->__set('_foo') - calls peGet/peSet for specified fields or objects
**** TODO check if all other model members can become *protected*
      - [ ] replace "_" with "int"; 
      - [ ] calliing __get for "int" property which is not a data field must show DEPRECATED warning;
*** WORK SELECT LISTs based on Chosen and/or Select2	  :forms:feature:hot:
*** WORK Finish hierarchical tests [2014-02-05 Wed]
**** TODO Complete basic test cycle: ability to run the tests
     - [ ] Determined and well-specified execution order
     - [ ] Compare probes' reports with nominal values
     - [ ] Reporter, Writer
**** TODO Form tests
**** TODO Table tests
**** TODO SQL tests
** Not started
*** TODO think about fields that are part of foreign key [2014-03-05 Wed]
    - Example A: userAvatar is referenced by both user->id and user->photoId. 
      $user->id must serve as a restriction of photo ValueList while photoId must behave normally.
      This behaviour must be enabled in case when second field is part of other foreign key or record unique index, 
      or is a non-NULL value.
*** TODO tests for Ac_Form [2013-11-23 Sat]
*** TODO Forms and controls should not be descendants of Ac_Controller anymore :forms:redesign:
    Practice had shown that has no sense, burdens a class interface and confuses developer.
**** TODO improve forms					     :forms:redesign:
***** TODO incomfort to use and inflexible templates and wrappers
***** TODO non-clear and hard to understand lifecycle of elements, which should act like full-scaled widgets
***** TODO better way to provide form defaults
***** TODO ability of array-returning controls to write their values into the root of form' value array.
           that will give us ability to create elements which edit several model' properties at once.
***** TODO uniform method to update model from the froms
      Currently where are two concurrent methods: $form->updateModel() and $model->bind($form->getValue())
      In some cases these methods produce different results.
      - [ ] See, how Ac_Admin_Manager does
      - [ ] Always use $form->updateModel()
      - [ ] Make its' behaviour as close to bind() as possible
      - [ ] bind() is almost abandoned, it's better to remove or improve it
**** TODO convert Ac_Sql_*, Ac_Form_*, Ac_Table_* to Ac_Prototyped :framework:redesign:incompat:
     - [ ] convert all *var $foo* to get/set, make sure everything is working
     - [ ] throw errors when encountering unknown objects or mis-configuration
***** Tests
**** TODO [2013-11-23 Sat] tests for Ac_Table*
**** TODO [2013-11-23 Sat] tests for Ac_Sql*
*** TODO Support composite PKs by stock Ac_Model_Mapper and Ac_Model_Object [2014-02-05 Wed] 
*** TODO Admin: allow to sort table by clicking on headers [2014-02-05 Wed]  
**** TODO basic solution
**** TODO ability to specify own sort expressions
*** TODO Get rid of Ac_Model_Collection::getStatementTail(), since not all DBMS have limit clause [2013-11-11 Mon]  
**** Make E_DEPRECATED, that's all
*** TODO Ac_Admin_Manager returnUrl on save()/cancel() [2013-11-11 Mon] 	      :admin:feature:
       	 Also $returnToReferer  would be nice.
*** TODO decorators' access to the model		      :model:feature:
*** TODO Ac_Widget_Menu [2014-03-12 Wed]		     :widget:feature:
*** TODO Add "libraries" class to add common JS and CSS frameworks [2013-10-26 Sat] :js:feature:
       	 The idea is to provide ability to quickly add jQuery, chosen, bootstrap & so on.
       	 Adapter must serve as factory or as configurator for Libraries' instances to avoid
       	 conflicts with libraries bundled with the CMS.
*** TODO Ac_Form_Control doesn't show errors, when model isChecked() == false (but should?) :model:redesign:
    Should it?
    If application populates model's _errors array from outside, shouldn't _checked altready be set to TRUE?
    How externally-provided errors should merge with model's own errors?
*** TODO Ac_Model_Values_Records refactor to use Ac_Sql_Select instance generated by Ac_Model_Mapper::getSqlSelectPrototype() :model:feature:
*** TODO when trying to get transitional property with index of no-existent object, return NULL instead of displaying an error (see example above) :model:annoyance:
*** TODO inability to 'properly' set default order in admin manager really pisses me off :admin:annoyance:
*** TODO Integrate table, actions, sub-managers and filters into a common form (they must all be controls) :admin:feature:
*** TODO support of readOnly (getter-only) model properties (which should be understood by other components) :model:feature:
*** TODO figure out format of 'property' (getter + setter) docblocks, finally :docs:design:
*** TODO PSR-2 code style compliance				     :global:
*** TODO composer support					     :global:
*** TODO uniform terms				:framework:redesign:incompat:

    - [ ] dataPath instead of fieldName, modelPropertyName, path etc
    - [ ] visible instead of hidden
    - [ ] enabled instead of disabled
    - [ ] writeable instead of readOnly
    - [ ] displayOrder/creationOrder instead of ordering or order
*** TODO better specification of 'path' with getters support	:base:design:
    - examples:
      - foo[bar.3][baz(true)][quxx]
      - foo->getBar()[3]->getBaz(true)->quux
    - Important! Wrong method or property must throw an excepton; 
      if transitional segment returns not an object or there is an array element missing,
      no exception must be thrown.
      - foo[@bar] - if there is no array key @bar, don't throw an error
*** TODO ? rename Ac_Prototyped::factory* to Ac_Prototyped::create* :base:incompat:
*** TODO Test generator				    :framework:feature:major:
    If model & scaffolding is generated, we can automatically create tests (API and HTTP-based) for regular CRUD,
    since that allows to detect common issues. In the future, such tests can be made extensible.
    Also we can generate test datasets.

*** TODO Automatic injection of dependencies into Application components [2013-08-27 Tue] :base:design:
    Controller, mapper, service object are Application components.
    For example, if a component has method setDb(Ac_Sql_Db $db), then such method should be automatically called
    by Ac_Application instance using value from $this->getDb().
    Questions:
    - how to define the matches between application properties and components' dependencies?
    - what to do with components created by components?

    - Example:
      - orders A, B and line items A.1, A.2, A.3, B.1, B.2
      - we select line items $lineItems := A.1, B.2
      - we use $orderMapper->loadForLineItems($lineItems)
      - Ac_Relation::linkBack sets back references $orderA->_lineItems[1] = A.1, $orderB->_lineItems[2] = B.2
      - from now on, $orderA->listLineItems() will return only A.1 
      - but listLineItems() should return all line items!
    - Proposed solution:
      - for each 'to many' link add var $_lineItems_loaded = false in addition to $_lineItems = false
      - listLineItems($onlyLoaded = false) - if array is partially populated, it will be fully populated
      - relation must NOT overwrite objects that were already pre-loaded

** Thoughts
*** Qualifiers concept [2014-08-03 Sun]
    - The idea of using array keys as qualifiers creates unnecessary complications, 
      so I abandon it completely.
      - requires tracking of all incoming references
      - requires many unnecesary computations just to keep array keys' sane
      - complicates adding of references into array members
      - and, probably, creates of other problems I'm not aware off
    - Still srcQualifier and destQualifier can be used by Ac_Model_Relation but it has 
      limited usages
    - Model qualifiers will be used by models when logical relation will be created
      instead of 'physical' relation
    - Instead of having 'qualifier is key' idea we can use 'dynamic' qualifiers
      - $foo->listBars($onlyLoaded, $qualifier) => will compute dynamically
	(when default qualifier is used, $qualifier is always default qualifier)
      - $foo->getBar($keyValue, $qualifier) => same (also obey default qualifier)
	- since qualifier uniquely identifies related record, will play nicely
	  with partially-loaded associations
	  - is related object found?
	    - yes: return it
	    - no: load all remaining and then try to return it
*** How partially-loaded associations will work with Ac_Model_Relation? [2014-08-03 Sun]
    - [ ] Deleted N-N records
    - [ ] Not adding objects that were already loaded
    - [ ] Not instantiating objects that were already loaded
      - What if mapper::useRecordsCollection() is not enabled?
      - Proposed solution: collect all loaded records, then identify them by PKs (if any)
*** How model changes will reflect on in-memory relations? [2014-08-03 Sun]
    - Example: 
      $country = $countryMapper->getById(10);
      $prov = $country->getProvince(1);
      $prov->countryId = 12; // should be in $country->listProvinces() no more
    - Solution a: observer <- complicates things
    - Solution b: always check by listProvinces() <- requires more intensive computations
    - Both solutions are related to qualifiers
